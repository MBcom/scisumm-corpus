we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part of speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data , but have translated text in a resource - rich language .  our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language ( in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed ) , making it applicable to a wide array of resource - poor languages . we describe a novel approach for inducing unsupervised part- of speech taggers for languages that have no labeled training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language.our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language ( in particular no dictionary tagging is assumed ) , making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language ( in particular no dictionary tagging is assumed ) , making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.for each language under consideration , petrov et al.for each language under consideration , petrov et
