we present kenlm , a library that implements two data structures for efficient language model queries .  the structure uses linear probing hash tables and is designed for speed . compared with the widely- srilm , our is 2.4 times as fast while using 57% of the mem- the structure is a trie with bit - level packing , sorted records , interpolation search , and optional quantization aimed lower memory consumption . simultaneously uses less memory than the smallest lossless baseline and less cpu than the baseline . this paper presents methods to query n-gram language models , minimizing time and space costs.dynamic programming efficiently scores many hypotheses by exploiting the fact that an n-gram language model conditions on at most n  ‚Åá  1 preceding words.this paper presents methods to query n-gram language models , minimizing time and space costs.statistics are printed before moses exits and after parts of the decoder have been destroyed .
