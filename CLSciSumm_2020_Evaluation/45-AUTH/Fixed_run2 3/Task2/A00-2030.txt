we present a probabilistic context - free parsing algorithm for extracting information from a lexical al ized template .  the algorithm is tested on muc-7 template elements and evaluated on muc-7 template relations . we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (lpcfg-hr ) to information extraction.in this paper , we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (lpcfg-hr ) to information extraction.in this paper , we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (lpcfg-hr ) to information extraction.in this paper , we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (lpcfg-hr ) to information extraction.in this paper , we report adapting a
