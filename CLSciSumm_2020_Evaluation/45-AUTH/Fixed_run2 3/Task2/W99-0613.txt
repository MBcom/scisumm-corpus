this paper discusses the use of unlabeled examples for the problem of named entity classification . a large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain , suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classi- however , we show that the use of data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple &quot; seed&quot; rules . in this paper we describe two methods for supervised learning of named entities.the first method is a generalization of yarowsky s boosting algorithm for supervised learning tasks.the second method is a generalization ofblum and mitchell s cotraining algorithm.in the first method yarowsky s algorithm was designed for supervised learning tasks.in the second method yarowsky s algorithm was adapted to the problem of classifying web pages.in both methods yarowsky s algorithm was designed for supervised learning tasks.in the second method yarowsky s algorithm was adapted to the problem of classifying web pages.
