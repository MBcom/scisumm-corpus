we consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate . much of the study of grammatical systems in computational linguistics has been focused on the weak generative capacity of grammatical formalism.in considering the relationship between formalisms , we show that it is useful abstract away from the details of the formalism , and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by context- free grammars on the basis of this observation , we describe a class of formalisms which we call linear context- free rewriting systems ,
