this paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and sentences in vector space . central to our approach is vector composition which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions .  we introduce a wide range of composition models which we evaluate empirically on a sentence similarity task .  experimental results demonstrate that the multiplicative models are superior to the additive alternatives when compared against human judgments . this paper proposes a framework for representing the meaning of phrases and sentences in vector space.any model of composition must be able to represent argument- judgments meaning.these included three additive models, iverbequation ( add ) , weighted addition ( weightadd ) , and kintsch vector-based model (equation of kintsch ) , a multiplicative model (equation multiply ) , and a model which combines multiplication with addition (equation multiply ) . despite the popularity of additive models , our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations , our
