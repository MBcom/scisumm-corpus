this paper describes the functioning of a broad-coverage probabilistic topdown parser , and its application to the problem of language modeling for speech recognition . a lexicalized probabilistic topdown parser is then presented , which performs very well in terms of both the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found , relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers . a new language model that utilizes probabilistic topdown parsing is then outlined , and empirical results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity . in this paper , we describe a top-down parser for probabilistic speech recognition .  our approach is based on the use of statistically based heuristic search heuristics , and the pruning of the search-space as more and more conditioning events are extracted from the guidance and more conditioning returns are extracted from the guidance for use in the probabilistic model . also , the parserspecification a set of candidate parses , from which we have been choosing the top ranked parser .  if we use an oracle to choose the parse with the highest accuracy from among candidates ( which averaged 70.0 in number per sentence )
