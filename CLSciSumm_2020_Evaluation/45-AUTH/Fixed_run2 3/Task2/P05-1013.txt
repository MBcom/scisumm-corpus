we show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser , in itself restricted to projective structures , can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce nonprojective structures .  experiments using data from the prague dependency treebank show that the combined system can handle nonprojective constructions with a precision sufficient to yield a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy . in order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing , it is desirable to allow nonprojective dependency structures.in order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing , it is desirable to allow nonprojective dependency structures.in order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing , it is desirable to allow nonprojective dependency structures
