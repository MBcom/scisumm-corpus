we introduce a polylingual topic model that can be used to discover topics aligned across multiple languages and to support machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages .  we explore the model s characteristics using two corpora , each with over ten different languages , and demonstrate its usefulness in supporting machine translation and tracking topic trends across languages . the polylingual topic model ( pltm ) is an extension of latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) for modeling polylingual document tuples.it is important to note that these results do not imply that lda needs to be preferred over pltm.in this paper , we use two polylingual corpora to answer various critical questions related to polylingual topic models.the second corpus , articles in languages , contains sets of documents that are very likely to be similar about sets similar about documents that are not another another.an important application for polylingual topic modeling is to use small numbers of comparable document
