we introduce a new semantic representation for latent logical forms which highlights a parallel between dependency syntax and efficient evaluation of logical forms in this paper we describe a system that learns to map questions to answers via latent logical forms.as in clarke et al.(2009 ) , we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.as in clarke et al.(2009 ) , our system learns lexical associations between programming language tailored to natural language, words and predicates.we start with some definitions , using us geography as an example domain.we start with some definitions , using us geography as an example domain.
