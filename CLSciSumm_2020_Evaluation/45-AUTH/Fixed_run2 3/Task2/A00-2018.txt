we present a new parser for parsing down to penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of 40 and less , and for of length 100 and less when trained and tested on the previously established &quot; standard&quot; sections of the wall street journal treebank . we present a new parser for parsing down to penn tree-bank style parse trees that achieves 90.1% average precision/recall for sentences of 40 and less , and for of length 100 and less when trained and tested on the previously established &quot;standard&quot; sections of the wall street journal treebank.this is as opposed to the &quot;markovgrammar&quot;; approach used in the current parser.for runs with the generative model based upon markov grammar statistics , the first pass uses the same statistics , but conditioned only on standard pcfg information.the results of achieved by combining
