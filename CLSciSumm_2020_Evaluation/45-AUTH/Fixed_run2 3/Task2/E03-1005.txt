in this paper we present a new dop model which outperforms existing dop models in accuracy and efficiency on the wall street journal treebank . this paper revisits the statistical parsing model sl-dop and its variants ls-dop and sl-ls-dop.in sl-dop , the parser selects the simplest tree from among the n most probable trees , where n is a free parameter.in ls-dop , the parser selects the simplest tree from among the n most probable trees , where n is a free parameter.in sl-ls-dop , the parser selects the simplest tree from among the n most probable trees , where n is a free parameter.in this paper , we introduce a
