we propose a cascaded linear model for joint chinese word segmentation and partof-speech tagging . with a character - based perceptron as the core , combined with realvalued features such as language models , the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly .  experiments show that the cascaded model achieves improved accuracies on both segmentation only and joint segmentation and partof-speech tagging . on the penn chinese treebank 5.0 , we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part- of - speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.2 segmentation and pos given a chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and pos result can be depicted as: here , ci ( i = l.n ) denotes chinese character , ti ( i = l.m ) denotes pos tag , and cl:r ( l  ‚Åá  r) denotes character sequence ranges from cl to cr. we find that the cascaded model achieves a f-measure increment of about 0.5 points on segmentation and joint
