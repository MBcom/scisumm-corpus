we present a two - stage multilingual pendency parser and evaluate it on 13 diverse languages . this paper presents a two - stage multilingual pendency parser and an evaluation on 13 diverse languages.the first stage is based on unlabeled dependency parsing models described by mcdonald and pereira augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.this system is primarily based on models described by mcdonald and pereira augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.this system is primarily based on models described by mcdonald and pereira augmented with an approximate nonprojective and an approximate projective algorithm.that work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph.that work generalizes the
