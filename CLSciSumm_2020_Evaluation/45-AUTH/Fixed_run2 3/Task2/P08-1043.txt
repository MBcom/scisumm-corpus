we present a joint model for morphological segmentation and syntactic disambiguation in the hebrew language . using a treebank grammar , a data - driven lexicon , and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling technique our model outperforms previous pipelined , integrated or factorized systems for hebrew morphological and syntactic processing , yielding an error reduction of 12% over the best published results so far . morphological ideally , we would use an of-the- morphological analyzer for mapping each input token to its possible analyses.this analyzer setting is similar to that of (cohen and smith , 2006 ) , and models using it are denoted nohsp , parser and grammar we used bitpar , an efficient general purpose parser , 10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis. secondly , for all our models we provide better fine- and coarse-grained pos-tagging accuracy , and all pruned models outperform the oracle results reported by them.
