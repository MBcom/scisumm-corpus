this paper presents a statistical parser for the penn treebank .  the parser is a combination of three state - of - the - art statistical parsers .  two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described . both parametric and non - parametric models are explored .  the resulting parsers surpass the best previously published performance results for the penn treebank . we describe a hybridization technique that combines multiple highly accurate statistical parsers to produce more accurate parses and new bounds on achievable treebank parsing accuracy . combining multiple highly accurate statistical parsers yields promising results.three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses , as well as new bounds on achievable treebank parsing accuracy .
