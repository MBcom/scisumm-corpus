in this letter we present a method to determine whether or not a translationally invariant hamiltonian can be used to describe a physical system .  the method is based on the fact that a translationally invariant hamiltonian can be used to describe a physical system .  we show that a translationally invariant hamiltonian can be used to describe a physical system if and only if the physical system is invariant .  we apply the method to the case of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants and @xmath in this paper , we investigate the relationship between automatic scoring methods such as bleu and human judgements based on the europarl corpus.while we confirm the finding by callison-burch et al.that the rule-based system of systran is not adequately appreciated by bleu.in-domain systran scores on this metric are lower than all statistical systems , even the ones that have much worse human scores . we confirm the finding by callison-burch et al.that the rule-based system of systran is not adequately appreciated by bleu.while a recent study pointed out that this correlation may not always be strong
